Deletion of User Data Policy
----------------

### Introduction  
Our user data deletion policy is completely public and can be accessed by anyone whether or not they are a Finder user.

### Steps to follow for a user who wants to delete all their data from our system

* Enter the Finder application, log in with your Finder account or with Google or Facebook.
* Click on the "About" section in the left side menu.
* The user will find several options to contact the Finder team but at the bottom of the screen it will say that if the user is looking for the option to delete all their information from Finder to click on a button with a Gmail logo.
* Clicking on the button will open an option to send an email to contacto.finderapp@gmail.com, the email must be sent from the same email that you used to register in Finder, Google or Facebook, if the email from which the email was sent does not match the one registered in our database the email will be ignored by the Finder team.
* (Optional) attach images or screenshots of any reason why you made the decision to remove information from Finder.
* Finally the user must send the mail.


Take into account that the information removal time would take no more than 48 hours. After this time has elapsed, all information such as account, objects saved in the Finder app in the "gallery" section will be permanently and unrecoverably deleted from the Finder servers. I disclaim all blame for not backing up your save items in the Finder app in the "gallery" section.
