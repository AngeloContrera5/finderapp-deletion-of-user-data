Deletion of User Data Policy
----------------

### Introduction  
Our user data deletion policy is completely public and can be accessed by anyone whether or not they are a Finder user.

### Information Collection and Use  
For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to users name, email address, gender, location, pictures. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.  
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. 

### Steps to follow for a user who wants to delete all their data from our system

* Send an email to contacto.finderapp@gmail.com with the subject "Removal of user information from Finder"
* Write the exact reason for the decision to delete the information from Finder
* Optional attach images or screenshots of any reason why you made the decision to remove information from Finder


Take into account that the information removal time would take no more than 48 hours. After this time has elapsed, all information such as account, objects saved in the Finder app in the "gallery" section will be permanently and unrecoverably deleted from the Finder servers. I disclaim all blame for not backing up your save items in the Finder app in the "gallery" section.
